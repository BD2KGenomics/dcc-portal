		The ICGC has joined forces with commercial and academic compute cloud partners to remove many of the barriers that prevent researchers from using the ICGC's vast genomic database. The large size of the ICGC datasets means that they can take months to download and analysing them requires computing power that many research groups do not have. These partnerships will allow scientists to access and analyze ICGC datasets through multiple cloud computing platforms, enhancing collaboration and accelerating the development of new tools and treatments for cancer patients.

      The Cancer Genome Collaboratory is an academic compute cloud resource built by the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and hosted at the Compute Canada facilities. This infrastructure is still under intensive development and is currently storing only a small subset of the ICGC data for beta testing.

		<h3>A unified interface for searching and accessing data across all clouds </h3>
		<p class="indent">
      The ICGC Data Coordination Center (DCC) has developed advanced tools enabling authorized researchers to search and efficiently access data stored on supported clouds. The process starts with the DCC identifying ICGC BAM and VCF data and curating their metadata to ensure accuracy.  Much of the initial dataset came from the <a href="/pcawg">ICGC PanCancer</a> project which uniformly aligned and variant called over 2,700 tumor/normal pairs.  Once curated, data files are assigned a unique File ID to help to identify copies stored in different cloud environments.  Data is then uploaded to an encrypted data store on the clouds.  Finally, the uploaded data is indexed to link files to the DCC Data Portal.  Users can then access the ICGC BAM and VCF files through search tools on the Portal, retrieving manifest files that allow for bulk file downloads from the cloud repository.  User authentication and authorization is achieved through the standard ICGC DACO controlled access mechanism ensuring safe access to these datasets.
