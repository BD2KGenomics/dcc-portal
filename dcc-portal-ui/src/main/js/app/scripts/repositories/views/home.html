		<p>The ICGC has joined forces with commercial and academic compute cloud partners to remove many of the barriers that 
			prevent researchers from using the ICGC's vast genomic database. The large size of the ICGC datasets means that they 
			can take months to download and analyzing them requires 
			computing power that many research groups do not have. These partnerships will allow scientists to access and analyze 
			ICGC datasets through multiple cloud computing platforms, enhancing collaboration and accelerating the development of new 
			tools and treatments for cancer patients.</p>

	<h3>(Logo) Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3>
	<p>
		AWS is a well established commercial cloud providing a highly reliable, scalable, 
		low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud in 190 countries around the world. ICGC datasets are currently hosted at the
		US East (Northern Virginia) EC2 facility.

		<h3>(Logo) The Cancer Genome Collaboratory</h3>
		<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The Cancer Genome Collaboratory is an academic compute cloud resource built by the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and hosted at the Compute Canada facilities. The infrastructure is still under intensive development and currently stores a small subset of the ICGC data for beta testing.

		<h3>A unified interface for searching and accessing data across all clouds </h3>
		<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The ICGC Data Coordination Center (DCC) has developed advanced tools enabling authorized researchers to search and access efficiently data stored on supported clouds. Raw data files are assigned with a unique File ID to help to identify copies in the different clouds. A text here describing the instrumental roles of the DCC and giving an overview of the architecture in term of multiple clouds integration: </span></p>
		<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Gather data and build datasets, upload data (encryption), cure metadata and create a unique File ID for each ICGC file, link data to ICGC donors, harmonize metadata.  GUIs for searching cloud content from the portal, create manifest used by cloud download client, ensure security (user authentication and authorization with DACO), high performing tools for downloading data (support BAM slicing). </span></p>
		<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A figure would help.</span></p>
		<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong>Problem</strong> is this is done only for AWS and Collab at the moment. Tried to contact ShareSEQ  but to no avail</span></p>
